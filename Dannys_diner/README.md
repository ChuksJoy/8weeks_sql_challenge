This is part of Danny Ma's 8 weeks SQL challenge. You can find the challenge on his LinkedIn Profile @ Danny Ma or [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## Background
Danny who loves japanese food, opened up a small restaurant to sell his 3 favorite foods and needs help to keep the restaurant afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Challenge
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, which will hep him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. 
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
* sales
* menu
* members

Then we can go on ahead and answer the questions
PS: Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

## Case Study Questions
* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
* How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
* What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
* What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
* Which item was the most popular for each customer?
* Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
* Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
* What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
* If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
* In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B   have at the end of January?
