    FROM customer_orders;

| pizza_order_count |
| ----------------- |
| 14                |


---2. How many unique customer orders were made?

 FROM customer_orders AS c
 JOIN runner_ordersv1 AS r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
 WHERE r.distance != ''
 GROUP BY c.order_id

SELECT MAX(pizza_per_order) AS max_no_of_pizzas_in_single_order
FROM total_pizza_per_order

Result: 3

---7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

SELECT c.customer_id,
	SUM(CASE 
		WHEN c.exclusions <> ' ' OR c.extras <> ' ' THEN 1
		ELSE 0
		END) AS with_changes,
	SUM(CASE 
		WHEN c.exclusions = '' OR c.extras = ' ' THEN 1 
		ELSE 0
		END) AS no_changes
FROM customer_orders AS c
JOIN runner_ordersv1 AS r
	ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.distance != ''
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id

"customer_id"	"with_changes"	"no_changes"
      101	          2	            3
      102	          2	            3

  ELSE 0
  END) AS pizza_count_w_exclusions_extras
FROM #customer_orders AS c
