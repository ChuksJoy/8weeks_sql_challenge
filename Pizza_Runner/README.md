You can find in-depth information about the data and entity-relationship of the case study [Here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)

# Background 
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!
Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) 
He maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.
All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema
